LoopingViewPager
================

An android ViewPager extension allowing infinite scrolling.


You can use it with "standart" `PagerAdapter` (inflating the pager with `Views`),   
but you can also use `FragmentPagerAdapter` which allows you to fill the pager with `Fragments`!   

The ViewPager will actually create 2 additional Views/Fragments to fake the infinite loop.

This ViewPager is fully compatible with [ViewPagerIndicator][1], and [PagerSlidingTabStrip][2]!



Usage
-----

To use it simply change `<android.support.v4.view.ViewPager>` to `<com.zyq.viewpager.LoopViewPager>`

If your `PagerAdapter` is used only to create `Views` (i.e. you don't use `FragmentPagerAdapter` or `FragmentStatePagerAdapter`),
then no more code changes are needed!


If you want to use `LoopViewPager` with `FragmentPagerAdapter` or `FragmentStatePagerAdapter`
additional changes in the adapter must be done.    
The adapter must be prepared to create 2 extra items e.g.:    
* The original adapter creates 4 items: `[0,1,2,3]`   
* The modified adapter will have to create 6 items `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`   
* with mapping `realPosition=(position-1)%count`   
* `[0->3, 1->0, 2->1, 3->2, 4->3, 5->0]`


Sometimes "blinking" can be seen when paginating to first or last view (e.g. when you have a `NetworkImageView` in your layout). 
To remove this effect, simply call setBoundaryCaching( true ) on your `LoopViewPager`,
or change `DEFAULT_BOUNDARY_CASHING` to true, if you want to set boundary caching
on all `LoopViewPager` instances. This will prevent the first and last element from being destroyed,
and every time they need to be displayed the existing instances will be used.
